# UIDAI Enrolment Analysis

This project analyzes Aadhar enrolment data.

## Structure

- `src/`: Source code modules.
- `data/`: Data files (raw and processed).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main analysis:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Note

Data files have been moved to `data/raw/` for better organization. You may need to update `src/config.py` paths to point to the new location if you haven't already.
